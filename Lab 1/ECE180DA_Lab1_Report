Lab 1 Report

I enrolled into this class on Thursday and was not able to attend Lab 1. But, I visited the TA Pengrui for his OH and he helped me out a lot. 
I was able to do all the installations very easily and was able to look up things whenever I got stuck anywhere.
The Image Processing stuff was a little complicated but the TA and my teammate helped me out and I was able to get it.

Task 1
My repo should be visible at:
www.github.com/aryan-agarwal/180DA-WarmUp/.
All the requirements for task 1 have been satisfied.

Task 2
A sample file has been created and some random text has been added to it. It is visible in my GitHub repo under Lab 1.

Task 3
The code mentioned was written and run in the virtual environment. The expected result was achieved.
The code can be found under Lab 1 in my repo.

Task 4
1. I used a phone screen with a blue screen displayed. I also used a blue water bottle with a green background. The result with the bounding box can be seen in my repo. I only tracked the blue color and both of them gave me decent results. 

2. If the color is more dominant and bright, it is easier to track.

3. I used a blue screen and the phone brightness helps a lot. When brightness is low, the color cannot be recognised at all. Higher the brightness, easier to track.

4. More the brightness, easier to identify the color. It was more evident with the phone brightness. Initially I had problems with the code when I changed from BGR to RGB. When I commented that out, it worked perfectly fine.
