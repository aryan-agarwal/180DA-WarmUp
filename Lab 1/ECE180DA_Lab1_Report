Lab 1 Report

I enrolled into this class on Thursday and was not able to attend Lab 1. But, I visited the TA Pengrui for his OH and he helped me out a lot. 
I was able to do all the installations very easily and was able to look up things whenever I got stuck anywhere.
The Image Processing stuff was a little complicated but the TA and my teammate helped me out and I was able to get it.

1. I only tracked the blue color and both of them gave me decent results. 
2. If the color is more dominant and bright, it is easier to track.
3. Phone brightness helps a lot. 
4. More the brightness, easier to identify the color. It was more evident with the phone brightness.
